# 🔷 1️⃣ Algorithms & Their Time Complexities

## 🔹 Searching Algorithms

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space | Notes |
|------------|----------------|--------|--------|
| Linear Search | O(n) | O(1) | Works on unsorted data |
| Binary Search | O(log n) | O(1) | Requires sorted array |

---

## 🔹 Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm | Best | Average | Worst | Stable |
|------------|------|---------|--------|--------|
| Bubble Sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | Yes |
| Selection Sort | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(n²) | No |
| Insertion Sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | Yes |
| Merge Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | Yes |
| Quick Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n²) | No |
| Heap Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | No |

---

## 🔹 Graph Algorithms

| Algorithm | Time Complexity |
|------------|----------------|
| BFS | O(V + E) |
| DFS | O(V + E) |
| Dijkstra (Min Heap) | O(E log V) |
| Bellman-Ford | O(VE) |
| Floyd Warshall | O(V³) |

## 🔹 Tree Operations

| Operation | Average | Worst |
|------------|----------|--------|
| BST Search | O(log n) | O(n) |
| AVL / Red-Black Search | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| Heap Insert/Delete | O(log n) | O(log n) |

---

## 🔹 Hashing

| Operation | Average | Worst |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Insert | O(1) | O(n) |
| Search | O(1) | O(n) |
| Delete | O(1) | O(n) |

Worst case occurs due to collisions.
